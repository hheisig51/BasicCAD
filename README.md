## Base

### Description
___
This assignment has the student create a base for a caster in CAD. The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. (The last two sentences are borrowed, with permission, from Mr. Helmstetter's Template)

### Evidence
___
[The Base in Onshape (Now includes Mount on top of Base)](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/ec4f71bc24dd67e5a4c42758/w/aa547515301ff3d1e00384ab/e/31e05afe62628d183b900e9f)

### Reflection
___
This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
(Once again, borrowed this reflection from Mr. Helmstetter's template.)

My original, poorly written reflection: When doing a linear pattern to "duplicate" features in Onshape, I have to remember to change the settings to do a feature pattern. Remember this please, future Henry.

## Mount

### Description
___
On the Base, make a line 120mm off the left side. Extrude the face you create as a new part, and there you go! If you wish to create the base, look above. 
Additionally, you can create the Mount by using a modification on the Base instructions. Create a 120mm by 120mm (and 8mm thick) shape instead of 120mm x 200mm, and then only create 4 evenly spaced (10mm in diameter, and 20mm from each edge) circles, with a 25mm diameter circle in the middle.
