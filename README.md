## Base

### Description
___
This assignment has the student create a base for a caster in CAD. The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. (The last two sentences are borrowed, with permission, from Mr. Helmstetter's Template)

### Evidence

### Reflection
___
This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
(Once again, borrowed this reflection from Mr. Helmstetter's template.)

My original, poorly written reflection: When doing a linear pattern to "duplicate" features in Onshape, I have to remember to change the settings to do a feature pattern. Remember this please, future Henry.

## Mount

### Description
___
On the Base, make a line 120mm off the left side. Extrude the face you create as a new part, and there you go! If you wish to create the base, look above. 
Additionally, you can create the Mount by using a modification on the Base instructions. Create a 120mm by 120mm (and 8mm thick) shape instead of 120mm x 200mm, and then only create 4 evenly spaced (10mm in diameter, and 20mm from each edge) circles, with a 25mm diameter circle in the middle.

### Reflection
___
**ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE EASY WAY OUT!!**
I made the whole mount piece using the instructions provided, which took me about 5 minutes. I then realized I could just extrude off the Base, which took me about 30 seconds. So, that's my main piece of advice.

> Is there any more Mr. Heisig? That's a pretty lame reflection.

Why yes! There is! But, I find it rather rude that you called my reflection lame.


Anyways, let me tell you how I extruded the part. 
1. I made a line, bordering off the face I wanted to use.
2. Then, I extruded the face, and got my little mount!

You can use this idea of recycling your work to make so many shortcuts! If one thing is just a slightly modified version of another, just copy! No point in doing all the work all over if it's just going to function the exact same.
